    <h2>Welcome!</h2>
    <p>
      Hello, I am an artist born in Chennai, India, brought up in Dubai, U.A.E.
      I'm am currently in my 4th year persuing a Fine Arts Major & Digital Arts
      Minor in the California Institute of the Arts. I come from a background in
      mixed media art & experimental animation but also indulge in other
      indiscplianry fields I like. I like to meld different ideas & disparate fields of art & ideas to
      create something new. 
      
      Some of my work can sometimes be viewed as 'role-playing' where I try to 
      combine different perspectives & approaches in my work. So that general mindset seems to run throughout my work and the stylisitic choices I end up making. 
      

      
      My professional practice is Motion
      Design & Branding and I'm currently working on building my skills &
      portfolio, but I also love music, cooking, poetry,
      philosophy, film & visual art of different forms. 
      
    
      
      I am also part of a band called Royal Tandoor
      
      We sometimes like to have a performative element and try to role-play different charecters or aesthetics 
      and combine them to create something new, and so that general mindeset can make its way into our songs. 
      We are currently working on some recordings which which will have around 70-80 tracks, a triple EP of sorts.
      Some of the genres we like to cover are indie, ragtime, spoken word, vaudville, country, etc.
      
      Some musicians I also like are the Beach Boys, A.R Rahman, Wilco, Kanye West, Guided by Voices
