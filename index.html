    <h2>Welcome!</h2>

      Hello, I am an artist born in Chennai, India, brought up in Dubai, U.A.E.
      I'm am currently in my 4th year persuing a Fine Arts Major & Digital Arts
      Minor in the California Institute of the Arts. I mostly come from a
      background in mixed media art & experimental animation, but also indulge
      in other indiscplianry fields I like. Some of them are music, cooking,
      poetry, philosophy, film & visual art of different forms. I like to meld
      different ideas & disparate fields of art & ideas to create something
      intriguing & new. My

      My professional practice is Motion Design & Branding and I'm currently
      working on building my skills & portfolio. I like to work on Title
      Squences for music videos & films and am trying to persue a career within
      that field.
    </p>

      I also have a band called Royal Tandoor where I mostly play guitar
      & sing. Some of the genres we cover are indie, ragtime, spoken word,
      vaudville, country & others. We sometimes like to approach our music almost as
      'role-playing' different charecters/perspectices & like to have a general
      experiental approach. We are currently working on some recordings which
      which will have around 70-80 tracks (a triple EP of sorts) and will be
      released in December after mixing & production. Some musicians I also like
      and am inspired by are the Beach Boys, A.R Rahman, Wilco, Kanye West,
      Guided by Voices, Indian music, etc.
