        Shojo Beat was a shōjo manga magazine published in North America by Viz
        Media. Launched in June 2005 as a sister magazine for Shonen Jump, it
        featured serialized chapters from six manga series per issue, as well as
        articles on Japanese culture, manga, anime, fashion and beauty. Viz
        launched a related imprint of the same name for female-oriented manga,
        light novels and anime. Targeted at women aged 16 to 18, the first issue
        of Shojo Beat <em>launched</em> with a circulation of 20,000. By 2007,
        the average circulation was approximately 38,000 copies, with half
        coming from subscriptions rather than store sales. It was well received
        by critics, though some found the early issues
        <strong>boring and poorly written</strong>. In May 2009, Viz announced
        that it was discontinuing the magazine; the July 2009 issue was the last
        released. Fans were disappointed at the news. Industry experts felt its
        loss left female manga fans without a
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benigno_Aquino_III">magazine</a>
        of their own, but praised Viz for continuing the Shojo Beat imprint and
        branding for its shōjo manga and anime releases.
