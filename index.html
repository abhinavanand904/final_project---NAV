    <h2>Welcome!</h2>
    <p>
      Hello, I am an artist born in Chennai, India, brought up in Dubai, U.A.E.
      I'm am currently in my 4th year persuing a Fine Arts Major & Digital Arts
      Minor in the California Institute of the Arts. I come from a background in
      mixed media art & experimental animation but also indulge in other
      indiscplianry fields I like. I like to meld different ideas & disparate fields of art & ideas to
      create something new. 
      
      Some of my work can sometimes be viewed as 'role-playing' where I try to 
      combine different perspectives & approaches in my work. So that general mindset seems to run throughout my work and the stylisitic choices I end up making. 
      

      
      My professional practice is Motion
      Design & Branding and I'm currently working on building my skills &
      portfolio, but I also love music, cooking, poetry,
      philosophy, film & visual art of different forms. 
      
    
      
      I also have a band called Royal Tandoor 
      
      which is a 3 person band tha I like to indulge in
      performative I sometimes like to indulge in "role-playing different points
      of view" or or aesthetics. or in art subverting seemingly disaprate
      styles/ideas in art & music, and so that general mindset seems to run
      throughout my work and the stylisitic choices I end up making. I also am
      part of a band called Royal Tandoor where we indulge in experimental
      pop/indie/noise/electronic ideas with a sometimes whimsicial side to it.
      We recently finished recording our first record & we plan on trying to
      make it a triple album with around 80-90 tracks covering different
      ideas/genres. different ideas & entering differ which we plan on bieng a
      triple sort of album with many songs I am also part of an experimental
      band We As I explore more about what can or can't be done I like to And so
      some of my favourite artists ha Some of the design I'm interested in is
      Motion Design, Title sequences, Flash Credit scenes for films, music
      videos, adverts & the likes. But I also like to dei exploring the
      boundaries of functionaility & pragmatic use, but doesn't quite enter into
      the world of Fine Arts or I also love to indulge in Motion design, such as
      Title Sequences & Flash credits/animations for films, adverts, music
      videos, etc. I'm inspired by I am part of a band called Royal Tandoor &
      like to explore the and sometimes like to combine ideas from seemingly
      disparate worlds. WE currently recorded an Right as of now it is still
      Some musicians I like are the Beach Boys, A.R Rahman, Wilco, Kanye West
      but can sometimes shift to something else that makes me question some
      preconviced notions/ideas about art
