      Hello, I am an artist born in <strong> Chennai, India </strong> brought up
      in Dubai, U.A.E. I'm am currently in my 4th year persuing a Fine Arts
      Major & Digital Arts Minor in the California Institute of the Arts. I
      mostly come from a background in mixed media art & experimental animation,
      but also indulge in other indiscplianry fields I like. Some of them are
      music, cooking, poetry, philosophy, film & visual art of different forms.
      I like to meld different ideas & disparate fields of art & ideas to create
      something intriguing & new. My
      <a href="https://abhinavanand29.wixsite.com/arts">art website</a> can be
      viewed by clicking on the hyperlink.

    <p>
      My professional practice is Motion Design & Branding and I'm currently
      working on building my skills & portfolio. I like to work on Title
      Squences for music videos & films and am trying to persue a career within
      that field.
    </p>

      I also have a band called <em>Royal Tandoor</em> where I mostly play
      guitar & sing. Some of the genres we cover are indie, ragtime, spoken
      word, vaudville, country & others. We sometimes like to approach our music
      almost as 'role-playing' different charecters/perspectices & like to have
      a general experiental approach. We are currently working on some
      recordings which which will have around 70-80 tracks (a triple EP of
      sorts) and will be released in December after mixing & production. Some
      musicians & inspirations I like :

      <li>A.R Rahman</li>
      <li>Kanye West</li>
      <li>Wilco</li>
      <li>Guided by Voices</li>
      <li>Indian music</li>
    </ul>
