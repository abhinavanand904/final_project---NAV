    Hello, I am an artist born in Chennai, India, brought up in
    Dubai, U.A.E. I'm am currently in my 4th year persuing a Fine Arts Major & Digital Arts Minor in the California Institute of the 
    Arts. I come from a background in mixed media art &
    experimental animation but also indulge in other indiscplianry fields. I love to meld different ideas & disparate 
    fileds to create something intriguing. 
    
    My main professional practice is Motion Design & Branding and so I'm currently
    working on building my skills & portfolio, but some other interests also include music, cooking, poetry, philosophy, film & visual art of different forms. 
    
    
    I am currently studying Fine Arts & a Digital Arts Minor in CalArts and am in my 4th year nearing completion.

    carnatic music when I was young, but soon found more interest in playi I am
    studying a Fine Ars/Studio Arts Major in CalArts with a Digital Arts Minor
    and am currently in my 4th year nearing completion. I mostly indulge in
    graphic design as part of my professional practice and have been exploring
    more into Motion DEsign & Title sequences for films, music videos, adverts,
    etc. But I also love to explore interdisciplinary practices like music,
    cooking, poetry, philosophy & visual art of different forms. I'm a graphic
    designer that also is loves to indulge in music, cooking, words, & visual
    art of different forms.

    I like to indulge in performative 
    
    I sometimes like to indulge in "role-playing different points of view" or or aesthetics. or in art subverting seemingly disaprate styles/ideas in
    art & music, and so that general mindset seems to run throughout my work and the stylisitic choices I end up making.
    
    I also am part of a band called Royal Tandoor where we indulge in experimental pop/indie/noise/electronic ideas with a sometimes whimsicial side to it.

    We recently finished recording our first record & we plan on trying to make it a triple album with around 
    80-90 tracks covering different ideas/genres. 
    
    
    different ideas & entering differ
    
    
    which we plan on bieng a triple sort of album with many songs

    quite enter into the world of Fine Arts or I also love to indulge in Motion
    design, such as Title Sequences & Flash credits/animations for films,
    adverts, music videos, etc. I'm inspired by I am part of a band called Royal
    Tandoor & like to explore the and sometimes like to combine ideas from
    seemingly disparate worlds. WE currently recorded an Right as of now it is
    still  Some musicians I like are the Beach Boys, A.R
    Rahman, Wilco, Kanye West but can sometimes shift to something else that
    makes me question some preconviced notions/ideas about art
