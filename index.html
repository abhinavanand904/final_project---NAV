    Hello! I am an artist born in Chennai, India, but brought up in
    Dubai, U.A.E. I come from a background in mixed media, painting, drawing &
    experimental animation but also like to indulge in some other indiscplianry
    practices & meld them into something that seems interesting. 
    
    Among some of my other interests are I indulged in Indian
    carnatic music when I was young, but soon found more interest in playi I am
    studying a Fine Ars/Studio Arts Major in CalArts with a Digital Arts Minor
    and am currently in my 4th year nearing completion. I mostly indulge in
    graphic design as part of my professional practice and have been exploring
    more into Motion DEsign & Title sequences for films, music videos, adverts,
    etc. But I also love to explore interdisciplinary practices like music,
    cooking, poetry, philosophy & visual art of different forms. I'm a graphic
    designer that also is loves to indulge in music, cooking, words, & visual
    art of different forms. I also play in a band called Royal Tandoor which is a

    exploring the boundaries of functionaility & pragmatic use, but doesn't
    quite enter into the world of Fine Arts or I also love to indulge in Motion
    design, such as Title Sequences & Flash credits/animations for films,
    adverts, music videos, etc. I'm inspired by I am part of a band called Royal
    Tandoor & like to explore the and sometimes like to combine ideas from
    seemingly disparate worlds. WE currently recorded an Right as of now it is
    still  Some musicians I like are the Beach Boys, A.R
    Rahman, Wilco, Kanye West but can sometimes shift to something else that
    makes me question some preconviced notions/ideas about art
