    <h2>Welcome!</h2>

      Hello, I am an artist born in Chennai, India, brought up in Dubai, U.A.E.
      I'm am currently in my 4th year persuing a Fine Arts Major & Digital Arts
      Minor in the California Institute of the Arts. I mostly come from a
      background in mixed media art & experimental animation, but also indulge
      in other indiscplianry fields I like. Some of them are music, cooking,
      poetry, philosophy, film & visual art of different forms.I like to meld
      different ideas & disparate fields of art & ideas to create something
      intriguing. Some of my work can sometimes be viewed as 'role-playing'
      where I try to combine different perspectives & approaches in my work. So
      that general mindset seems to run throughout my work and the stylisitic
      choices I end up making.
    </p>
    <p>
      My professional practice is Motion Design & Branding and I'm currently
      working on building my skills & portfolio. All of which inspire my design
      work.
    </p>

      I am also part of an band called Royal Tandoor, where I mostly play guitar
      & sing. Some of the genres we like to cover are indie, ragtime, spoken
      word, vaudville, country, etc & have a general experimental approach. We
      are currently working on some recordings which which will have around
      70-80 tracks and will be released in December of this year after mixing &
      production. Some musicians I like are the Beach Boys, A.R Rahman, Wilco,
      Kanye West, Guided by Voices, Indian Carnatic music, etc.
